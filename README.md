# TuneView [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cebarks/TuneView.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cebarks/TuneView)
### Production Link: * [http://tuneview.herokuapp.com](http://http://tuneview.herokuapp.com/)

### Pitch

TuneView is a unique way to learn more about yourself and the way you listen to music.

### Problem

Users often sacrifice personalization for prebuilt playlists or complicated features that may never be used.

### Solution

Tuneview simplifies the process of viewing interesting stats about your music preferences.
